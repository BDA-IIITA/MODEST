Millions of people worldwide suffer from mental health illnesses, which put an enormous burden on healthcare systems because of social stigma and delayed diagnoses. An approach that shows promise for early detection is artificial intelligence (AI), specifically in the form of voice analysis and EEG readings. Through the analysis of voice and EEG data, this study explores machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) approaches to detect depression. The classification performance of several models, such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and Logistic Regression, is evaluated.

The MODMA dataset, which includes speech samples and EEG recordings from both healthy people and those with major depressive disorder (MDD), is used in this study. This dataset is essential for teaching AI models to identify speech-based and neurological markers of mental health issues.

Nonetheless, a number of obstacles still exist, such as the scarcity of data, the high expense of computation, and the possibility of losing significant characteristics in traditional machine learning models. The goal of this research is to create a trustworthy AI-powered mental health screening system by improving real-time processing, integrating various data sources, and optimizing model performance.

## Dataset
We utilize the **MODMA dataset**, which contains:
- **Speech samples** from healthy individuals and those with major depressive disorder (MDD).
- **EEG recordings**, capturing neurological markers of mental health conditions.

This dataset is critical for training AI models to detect mental health issues effectively.

## Objectives
1. **Develop AI-Driven Detection Techniques** – Implement ML and DL models to identify depression using EEG and speech data.
2. **Utilize the MODMA Dataset** – Extract key neurological and speech-based features to enhance mental health assessments.
3. **Compare Classification Models** – Evaluate SVM, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression for accurate depression detection.
4. **Overcome AI-Based Diagnosis Challenges** – Address small dataset limitations, computational complexities, and feature loss in ML models.
5. **Enhance Real-Time Processing & Accessibility** – Develop efficient AI models for real-world mental health screening.
 

## Expected Contribution
This study contributes to AI-driven mental health assessments, making **diagnosis more efficient, accurate, and widely accessible**. Our approach integrates EEG and speech analysis for improved early detection, aiding both clinicians and individuals in better mental health management.
