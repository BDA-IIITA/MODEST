# MODEST
The proposed research project MODEST aims to improve the existing state-of-the-art methods for identifying users with mental disorders by creating a multimodal framework that combines various sources of data, including visual data, textual data, and user interaction data. The scientific objectives of the proposed research are to develop a robust and accurate representation of a user's mental health state by fusing the features extracted from various sources of data and to identify patterns between demographic factors and mental illness.
The hypothesis to be tested is that a multimodal framework can improve the accuracy of identifying users with mental disorders by combining heterogeneous sets of features obtained from the processing of visual, textual, and user interaction data. The proposed model will be tested on publicly available datasets to evaluate its accuracy and robustness. The main experiments to be carried out in this research include developing a generalized multimodal fusion framework to automatically estimate mental disorder scores in the early stages, employing domain adaptation to capture the relationship between various factors that trigger different mental disorders, and using cross-attention mechanisms to generate a robust multimodal representation. The experiments will also involve testing the developed application by active participation of all stakeholders, including domain experts, caregivers, and other volunteers. The significance of this proposed research to the field of mental health is immense. By using a multimodal framework that takes demographic factors into consideration, this research can significantly improve the accuracy of identifying users with mental disorders and provide personalized interventions for better mental health outcomes. Additionally, the proposed framework can identify patterns between demographic factors and mental illness, leading to better health interventions. The dissemination of the project will result in the development of various resources, including project handbooks, toolkits, and reports, an online platform to display the ecosystem of needs, practices, target groups, and stakeholders, a project manifesto, a project network of stakeholders, and project events and activities. These resources will help increase knowledge of mental health issues, encourage individuals and governments to take action, and provide guidelines and roadmaps to researchers in similar fields.
