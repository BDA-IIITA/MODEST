## Modma Dataset
​The Multi-modal Open Dataset for Mental-disorder Analysis (MODMA) is a comprehensive dataset designed to facilitate the detection and analysis of mental disorders, with a particular focus on Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). It integrates electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings and speech data from individuals diagnosed with MDD and healthy control participants, providing a robust foundation for research into behavioral and neurological indicators of depression.​

### EEG Data:

#### 128-Channel EEG Recordings:

##### 1. Resting-State Recordings: 
Collected from 24 MDD subjects and 29 healthy controls, aged between 16 and 52 years. These recordings capture brain activity during rest, offering insights into the neural patterns associated with depression.​

##### 2. Event-Related Potential (ERP) Recordings:
Obtained from the same group of participants, these recordings measure brain responses to specific stimuli, aiding in understanding cognitive processes affected by MDD.​

#### 3-Channel EEG Recordings:
Resting-State Recordings: Acquired from 26 MDD subjects and 29 healthy controls, aged between 16 and 56 years. These recordings utilize a wearable 3-electrode EEG device, highlighting the potential for portable and accessible depression monitoring tools.

### Speech Data:

Speech recordings were collected from 23 individuals diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and 29 healthy controls, ranging in age from 18 to 52 years. The data was gathered through structured tasks, including interviews, reading assignments, and picture descriptions, allowing for the extraction of linguistic and emotional features relevant to mental health analysis. Table I provides an overview of the dataset, demonstrating that each data modality includes both MDD participants and healthy individuals.

#### Table I: MODMA Dataset Overview

| Modality   | Subjects                  | Method               | Features                     |
|------------|---------------------------|----------------------|------------------------------|
| **128-Ch EEG** | 53 (24 MDD, 29 Healthy) | Resting & ERP       | Brain activity              |
| **3-Ch EEG**   | 55 (26 MDD, 29 Healthy) | Resting EEG         | Neural patterns             |
| **Speech**     | 52 (23 MDD, 29 Healthy) | Interview, Reading  | Speech, Emotion             |


By offering a rich combination of EEG and speech data from both MDD patients and healthy individuals, the MODMA dataset serves as a valuable resource for advancing the understanding and detection of mental disorders.
