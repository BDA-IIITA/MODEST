## WESAD (Wearable Stress and Affect Detection)dataset
The WESAD dataset which is multimodal, was created for the purpose of recognizing stress and emotions through the use of wearable sensor technology. The dataset, gathered from 15 participants (12 males and 3 females) in a controlled study, encompasses three emotional states: neutral, stress, and amusement. The Trier Social Stress Test (TSST), a widely recognized method for provoking psychological stress, was used to induce stress levels

### Table I: Summary of WESAD Dataset

| Sensor Device  | Signals        | Description            |
|---------------|---------------|------------------------|
| **6 × RespiBAN** (Chest-Worn) | ECG  | Heart activity      |
|               | EDA  | Skin conductivity    |
|               | EMG  | Muscle activity      |
|               | RESP | Breathing patterns  |
|               | TEMP | Body temperature    |
|               | ACC  | Body movement       |
| **4 × Empatica E4** (Wrist-Worn) | BVP  | Heart rate variability |
|               | TEMP | Skin temperature    |

Table presents an overview of the dataset, detailing the wearable sensors used and the corresponding physiological signals recorded. The dataset includes signals from a sensor worn on the chest called RespirBAN. These signals include an electrocardiogram (ECG), electrodermal activity (EDA), respiration (RESP), and electromyography (EMG). It also includes additional signals from a wrist-worn sensor (Empatica E4), such as blood volume pulse (BVP), EDA, temperature, and acceleration.
